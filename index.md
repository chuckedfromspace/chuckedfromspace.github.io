## Where I have been

I grew up in the now (in)famous city of Wuhan in China
and studied Naval Architecture at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology there.
After that, I was trained as an experimentalist in laser spectroscopy and plasma physics at the [Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics Laboratory](https://netl.engineering.osu.edu/) at the Ohio State University in Columbus, OH, USA.
I'm currently a research scientist at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Stuttgart, Germany.
With my colleagues at the [Institute of Combustion Technology](https://www.dlr.de/vt/) at DLR, I'm working on new combustion systems that could handle low-carbon, sustainable fuels for both stationary gas turbines and aircraft engines.

## What I am interested in

As a latecomer, I only started learning Python in my very late 20s, mostly to replace the costly Matlab for processing experimental data. Programming and data science have since grown on me and have kept me busy in front of the computer during most of my free time (which have become especially excessive in this pandemic).
I recently started an open source "blog"/knowledge base, [Pythonize](https://chuckedfromspace.github.io/pythonize), where I plan to share my journey with Python on a wide variety of topics.

I'm also into:

- Reading novels (Harper Lee, Kurt Vonnegut, David Mitchell, Robert A. Heinlein, Ted Chiang, Kazuo Ishiguro, J.K. Rowling, etc)
- Jogging in the woods while listening to podcasts
- Hiking the [GR trails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GR_footpath) in France
- Learning to draw with pen and ink
