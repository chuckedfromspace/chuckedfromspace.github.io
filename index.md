title: About me
---
I'm a research scientist located in Stuttgart, Germany. With a background in laser spectroscopy and plasma physics, I'm currently dealing with new combustion technologies that could handle low-carbon, sustainable fuels for both stationary gas turbines and aircraft engines. Feel free to check out my (still few) repos on [Github](https://github.com/chuckedfromspace) and my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=de&user=_VHoPw0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) page.
